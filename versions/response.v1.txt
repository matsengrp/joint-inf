Felsenstein's book has a subsection entitled "The Farris zone" spanning two pages (pp 120-121), a figure entitled "A tree in the Farris zone.", and a table with a caption "Properties of the Felsenstein and Farris zones..."
The term "Farris zone" has almost 7 times as many citations as the term "inverse Felsenstein zone" on Google Scholar.
Thus, although we realize that the term causes offense, it is standard.

TODO: not sure what this is?

> - line 97 below (2) define A^p

We have clarified this with an explicit definition of A^p where we introduce A, at the beginning of the section on Phylogenetic maximum likelihood.

> - l106: why is the functional form of (3) determined by inequalites;

We have made this more precise and directly referenced the inequalities.

> - l 118-124: clarify are tau1 and tau2 Farris and Felsenstein?

That is correct, and we've added parenthetical notes to reminde the reader, thanks.

> L 132 clarify “equivalent but different notion” – different from what?

We have reformulated this sentence to avoid the comparison.

> - line 146 “seeing no change along a branch more likely increases the
> likelihood by introducing a term of (1 + θ) instead of (1 − θ)” – I

TODO: this is changed, but I don't see this being a lot clearer.

> line 185++ and figure5: true value of w?

We have added clarifying sentence:
"As data were generated with parameters $\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$, the true value for $w$ is $y^*$."


> L 334 missing “the”

Fixed via simpler language.

We have now made this much more explicit with three additional display equations spelling out the intermediate steps.

> L354 why does psi take the complement of site patterns? Just above it
> is defined as a random variable psi (Y) where Y is a site pattern

This wasn't as clear as it should have been. We have revised to:
"The mapping $\patternToSplit$ operates by returning the complement of a site pattern to obtain a site split in $\mathcal{P}(\siteSplitSet)$ if it is not in $\mathcal{P}(\siteSplitSet)$."


> What are the elements of the sets eta(tau, t)?

TODO: fill in

> Why is xi surjective? I don't understand the equation before line 359,
> and then I don't understand what “such a choice” is in line 359

We have made this explicit now, with two additional intermediate steps and an explicit explanation in terms of collapsing terms.

> line 364 define p(e)

Thanks for reminding us to define p(e), which is now described as "where $p(e)$ is the probability of a character change along edge $e$."
