TODO: add discussion of bootstrap

DISCUSS: we have no evidence of topological inconsistency

> Comments to the Author
> Shaw et al provided a revised version of the manuscript that I
> reviewed about a year ago showing that joint estimation of ancestral
> states and branch length is in general not consistent. The authors now
> map out the regions in which topologies are incorrectly estimated and
> include a plot that shows the bias of the internal branch length for

> But some parts are completely unsurprising, while some empirical

> The most important results/claims by Shaw et al are:

> 1) "jointly estimating phylogenetic parameters along with ancestral
> states is not consistent in general"... "only correct on a set of
> measure 0".
> It is clearly true that branch length will be biased. But the fact
> that joint estimation will not recover the true branch lengths is not
> surprising but perfectly expected. Joint estimation ignores subleading
> configurations of internal states. Since the subleading terms
> typically require more state changes, branch length estimates ignoring
> them are biased. In a similar way a Taylor expansion is almost nowhere
> "correct", but still a useful and insightful approximation (a better
> analogy is ignoring looped diagram in a diagrammatic expansion.).

> 3) "[The bias is] of the same order as the branch lengths themselves."
