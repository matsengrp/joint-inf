Thank you for handling the manuscript, and please thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. As stated by Reviewer 3, we believe that the review process has significantly improved the manuscript.

The reviewer is correct that this story is slightly different than the one in the previous version of the paper. Regarding the bootstrap, we remind the reviewer that we are interested in the case of "infinite data," and thus the bootstrap doesn't apply. We have also taken out the speculation about higher likelihoods on the wrong topology.

In our revised work we have found no evidence of topological inconsistency, and as mentioned above we have removed such speculation from the paper. "Machine precision" is not involved: w exactly equal to 1. That's its optimal value.

We use "integrated likelihood" in the same manner as Goldman. We have replaced "profile likelihood" with "joint objective function" throughout, unless we were specifically making a comparison with profile methods. We have removed references that are unrelated to the approaches considered in the manuscript, and defer these to the discussion for the interested reader to follow up with if they so choose. Thanks.

Thank you for your suggestion in point 1; we have added it to the introduction.
We have also clarified re point 2 that the joint objective function is related to profile likelihoods, but is not the same thing.

We have removed all instances of "multifurcating" with "zero internal branch length" except for two occurrences in the Discussion.

We realized that we could eliminate the xi (xi looks like zeta) from the notation in the main text. This is definitely an improvement in readability-- thanks!

We have added the suggested wording, thanks.

We focus in this paper in the limiting case only.
We have added a sentence clarifying language: "Because we are interested in the properties of joint inference in the limit of $n$ going to infinity, we will focus on estimates in this case and simply refer to the right hand side of \eqref{eq:exp-log-lik} as ``the estimator.''"


> -l186: which `likelihood terms' is not that clear to me: `each site

We have clarified this by specifying that we're talking about the joint likelihood expression here.

We have adopted the suggested wording, thanks.

We have rewritten this section to clarify what is being used where. Specifically, although we can find the regions for which the various ancestral state splits are optimal, we cannot obtain optimal branch lengths analytically.

We moved these figures into their current locations in response to a previous reviewer comment, who thought that Figure S2 was quite uninteresting while Figure 2 was relevant. We would prefer to leave them be. Figure 3 is an essential part of our argument that the internal branch length has substantial deviation from truth.

We agree, and have made the requisite changes: both replacing references to "profile likelihood" in the body of the text with "joint objective function", and by clarifying that they aren't quite the same things in the Discussion.

We have removed this reference in the Discussion. We use it to show a relatively well-known example where maximum likelihood fails for a similar reason as in the current case of joint inference of phylogeny. The discussion preceding this sentence shows that parameters tending to infinity are not a sufficient condition for inconsistency, which we believe is more clear having removed the reference to Neyman and Scott. We have removed the reference to the paper by LeCam. It explains various setting where maximum likelihood fails, including Neyman and Scott's example, but is not directly relevant to our argument.

I'm afraid that this fact wasn't obvious to us at the outset of this project. The interest that the other reviewers have shown in the manuscript confirms that it is not broadly obvious.

We have added this intuition, thank you!

We have worked this out with Dr. Neher and found that the difference lay in that he was not optimizing the objective function thoroughly and was getting stuck in a local optimum.

We have removed the "order" language, instead just focusing on the downward bias.

Thank you for your kind words.

Indeed, this was not present in the non-latexdiff pdf.

We have rewritten this confusing sentence in terms of complements, and have added a little bit of text pointing the reader to the formal definition just above.

Unfortunately a lot would have to change to generalize from the symmetric model. We would not be able to "collapse" site splits, and the Hadamard transform only works for submodels of the Kimura 3 parameter model. See, for example:

Bryant, D. (2009). Hadamard Phylogenetic Methods and the n-taxon Process. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 71(2), 339–351. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-008-9364-8


> What's q in equation 7 in the appendix (line 655) ?

We have inserted text reminding the reader that this is the number of site splits.


> More substantitvely, the limit in (8) seems not established because as

We have added text emphasizing that the number of taxa is fixed so q is fixed, and that although n_j goes to infinity the ratio n_j/n converges to the probability of seeing that column.

This is a good point! We have rephrased things, eliminating p_ytilde_j except for a parenthetical reference to the Appendix. We believe that the result is much more readable.

We have clarified the definitions of S and Y, and added that by path we mean graph-theoretic path. We are afraid that adding more detail about the Hadamard transform is beyond the scope of this paper, and it is well described in Semple and Steel's book.
