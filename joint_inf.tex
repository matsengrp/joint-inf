\begin{abstract}
Maximum likelihood estimation in phylogenetics requires a means of handling unknown ancestral states.
Classical maximum likelihood averages over these unknown intermediate states, leading to consistent estimation of the topology and continuous model parameters.
Recently, a computationally-efficient approach was proposed to jointly maximize over these unknown states and phylogenetic parameters.
Although this method of joint maximum likelihood estimation can obtain estimates more quickly, its properties as an estimator are not yet clear.
In this paper, we show that this method of jointly estimating phylogenetic parameters along with ancestral states is not consistent in general.
We find a set of parameters that generate data under a four-taxon tree for which this joint method estimates an incorrect topology in the limit of infinite-length sequences.
For branch length estimation on the correct topology, we outline similar cases where branch length estimates are consistently and heavily biased.

\section*{Introduction}

Classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in phylogenetics operates by integrating out latent ancestral states at the internal nodes of the tree.
In a recent paper, \citet{Sagulenko2017-jo} suggest using an approximation to ML inference in which the likelihood is maximized jointly across model parameters and ancestral sequences on a fixed topology.
This is attractive from a computational perspective: such joint inference can proceed according to an iterative procedure in which ancestral sequences are first estimated and model parameters are optimized conditional on these estimates.
This latter conditional optimization is simpler and more computationally efficient than optimizing the marginal likelihood.
But is it statistically consistent?

An estimator is said to be statistically consistent if it converges to the generating model with probability 1 in the large-data limit; existing consistency proofs for maximum likelihood phylogenetics \citep{Allman2008-wd,Chai2011-ff,RoyChoudhury2015-ta} apply only to estimating model parameters when the ancestral sequences have been integrated out of the likelihood.
These proofs do not readily extend to include estimating ancestral states.
Moreover, examples of inconsistency arising from problems where the number of parameters increases with the amount of data \citep{Neyman1948-tt} indicate that joint inference of trees and ancestral states may not enjoy good statistical properties.
In this case those additional parameters come in the form of the states of ancestral sequences.
%page 2 section 2.1 at the top of the second column first paragraph second sentence
Although the software described in \citet{Sagulenko2017-jo} fits on a user-supplied topology and the authors explicitly warn that the approximation is for the case where ``branch lengths are short and only a minority of sites change on a given branch,'' their work motivates understanding the general properties of such joint inference.
In particular, one would like to know when this approximate technique breaks down for both topology and branch length inference, even when sequence data is ``perfect,'' i.e., is generated without sampling error according to the exact model used for inference.

In this paper, we show that the joint inference of trees and ancestral sequences is not consistent in general.
To do so, we use a binary symmetric model with data being generated on the four-taxon ``inverse Felsenstein'' tree (a.k.a.\ the ``Farris'' tree) and we construct bounds on the joint objective function to demarcate a sizeable area of long branch lengths in which joint inference is guaranteed to give the wrong tree in the case of perfect sequence data with an infinite number of sites.
We find similar areas where joint inference consistently overestimates interior branch lengths when the topology is known and fixed.

\section*{Phylogenetic maximum likelihood}

Assume the binary symmetric model, namely with a character alphabet $\alphabet=\{0,1\}$ and a uniform stationary distribution \citep{Semple2003-em}.
Let $\nSiteRows$ be the number of tips of the tree, and $\nAncestralStateRows = \nSiteRows-2$ the number of internal nodes.
We observe $\nCols$ independent and identically distributed samples of character data, i.e., an alignment with $\nCols$ columns, $\fullAlignment=[\alignmentColumn_1,\ldots,\alignmentColumn_\nCols]\in\alphabet^{\nSiteRows\times\nCols}$ distributed as the random variable $\alignmentColumnRV$.
The corresponding unobserved ancestral states are $\fullAncestralStates=[\ancestralStateColumn_1,\ldots,\ancestralStateColumn_\nCols]\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows\times\nCols}$ and distributed as $\ancestralStateColumnRV$ with each $\ancestralStateColumn_i\in\alphabet^\nAncestralStateRows$.

We parameterize branches on the unique unrooted four-tip phylogenetic tree in ways known as the ``Inverse Felsenstein (InvFels)'' tree and the ``Felsenstein'' tree (Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}).
The ``inverse Felsenstein'' terminology comes from \citet{Swofford2001-hr}, although it is also called the ``Farris'' tree \citep{Siddall1998-hq, Felsenstein2004}.
In the standard configuration of each of these trees, the interior branch length parameters are equal to the bottom two parameters.
We show in the Appendix that, in the case of the InvFels tree, performing inference fixing both the top two branch parameters to be equal and the bottom two branch parameters to be equal will obtain the same maximum likelihood estimate as in the case of arbitrary branch parameters.

}
\label{fig:farris-fels-top}
\end{figure}

We parameterize the branches of these trees not with the standard notion of branch length in terms of number of substitutions per site, but with an alternate formulation called ``fidelity.''
The probability of a substitution on a branch with fidelity $\theta$ is $(1-\theta)/2$ while the probability of no substitution is $(1+\theta)/2$ where $0 \le \theta \le 1$.
This parameter quantifies the fidelity of transmission of the ancestral state across an edge \citep{Matsen2007-jq}.

Fidelities have useful algebraic properties.
As data becomes plentiful, we use the Hadamard transform (see \eqref{eq:hadamard_probability} in the Appendix) to compute the exact probabilities that generate each particular configuration of taxa---we call these ``generating probabilities''---and these have an especially simple form.
For a four-taxon tree, define the general branch fidelity parameter $t=\{\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3,\theta_4,\theta_5\}$ where fidelities are ordered in the order of the taxa with the internal branch last (Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}).
We show in the Appendix that, for the InvFels tree, the maximum likelihood fidelities require $\theta_1=\theta_3$ and $\theta_2=\theta_4$, so we subsequently fix fidelity parameters to $t=\{x,y,x,y,w\}$.

\subsection*{Two paths to maximum likelihood}

The standard phylogenetic likelihood approach on unrooted trees under the usual assumption of independence between sites is as follows.
For a topology $\tau$ and branch fidelities $t$ the likelihood given observed ancestral states $\fullAncestralStates$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:full_likelihood}
L_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment,\fullAncestralStates) = \prod_{i=1}^{\nCols} \ \Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t).
\end{equation}
The probability $\Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t)$ is a product of transition probabilities determined by $\fullAlignment$, $\fullAncestralStates$, $\tau$, and $t$ \citep{Felsenstein2004}.

The classical approach is to maximize the likelihood marginalized across ancestral states
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:marginal_likelihood}
\tilde{L}_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) = \prod_{i=1}^{\nCols} \ \sum_{\ancestralStateColumn_i\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows}} \ \Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t)
\end{equation}
to estimate the tree $\tau$ and branch fidelities $t$.

The alternative approach \citep{Sagulenko2017-jo} does away with the marginalization and directly estimates the maximum likelihood parameters of the fully-observed likelihood in \eqref{eq:full_likelihood}.
This is known in statistics as a profile likelihood \citep{Murphy2000-ry}, which exists here because $\alphabet$ is a finite set:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profile_likelihood}
L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) = \prod_{i=1}^{\nCols} \ \max_{\ancestralStateColumn_i\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows}} \ \Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t) = \max_{\fullAncestralStates\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows\times\nCols}} \ L_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment, \fullAncestralStates).
\end{equation}
We use $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}$ to denote an estimate for $\fullAncestralStates$ obtained by maximizing \eqref{eq:profile_likelihood}, and estimate a topology and branch fidelities using this profile likelihood as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profile_likelihood_topology_bl}
(\hat{\tau}, \hat{t}) = \argmax_{\tau, t} \ L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment).
\end{equation}
In general, the functional form of \eqref{eq:profile_likelihood} is determined by inequalities arising from taking maxima row-wise in Tables~\ref{tab:farris_likelihoods} and~\ref{tab:fels_likelihoods} to obtain the likelihood term for each most likely ancestral state, these terms depending on the unknown $(\tau, t)$.
For this reason, in practice, the joint inference strategy estimates $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}$ for a fixed $(\tau,t)$, then $(\hat{\tau},\hat{t})$ given $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}$, maximizing each of these conditional objectives until convergence \citep{Sagulenko2017-jo}.


\section*{Inconsistency of joint inference}

We now state our results on the inconsistency of joint inference.
All proofs are deferred to the Appendix.

Assume $\fullAlignment$ is generated from topology $\tau^*$ and branch fidelities $t^*$.
Use $\ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau, t)$ to denote the expected per-site log-likelihood, which can be thought of as the infinite-length sequence case
\[
\frac{1}{n}\log L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) \rightarrow \ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau, t).
\]
We give $\ell$ explicitly as \eqref{eq:site_pattern_profile_likelihood_mean} in the Appendix.

\subsection*{Inconsistency in topology estimation}

To show an inconsistency in topology estimation, we start with true generating parameters $t^*=\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$ on the InvFels topology (Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}a).
We show that, as $\nCols\rightarrow\infty$, there exist values for $x^*$ and $y^*$ such that the value of the likelihood after maximizing using joint inference is greater for the Felsenstein topology ($\tau_2$) than for the true, generating InvFels topology ($\tau_1$).
To do so, we construct an upper bound $C_0(x^*, y^*)$ for the likelihood given the InvFels topology as a function of $x^*$ and $y^*$ and, similarly, a lower bound $C_1(x^*, y^*)$ for the likelihood given the Felsenstein topology.
When $C_0(x^*, y^*) < C_1(x^*, y^*)$, the likelihood in the Felsenstein case is larger than the likelihood in the InvFels case, demonstrating inconsistency (Fig.~\ref{fig:inconsistency-farris}).
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{topoInconsist}
Let $t^*=\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$ and $t=\{x, y, x, y, w\}$.
There exist $C_0(x^*, y^*), C_1(x^*, y^*),$ and a set of $0 < x^*, y^* < 1$ such that
\[
\max_{t} \ \ell_{\tau_1,t^*}(\tau_1, t) \le C_0(x^*, y^*),
\]
\[
C_1(x^*, y^*) \le \max_{t} \ \ell_{\tau_1,t^*}(\tau_2, t)
\]
with $C_0(x^*, y^*) < C_1(x^*, y^*)$.
\end{restatable}
The proof of this theorem is by a detailed examination of inequalities.
Intuitively, $\tau_2$ is favored in performing joint inference since the objective function for $\tau_2$ has more ``degrees of freedom''---Table~\ref{tab:likelihoods} shows that $\tau_1$ has only three possible forms for its objective function while $\tau_2$ has many more.
This enables more possible maxima for $\tau_2$ even if data are generated from $\tau_1$.

    Due to the looseness of the upper and lower bounds, the parameters in the white region do not necessarily indicate consistency, though all parameters in the shaded region result in an inconsistency.
}
\label{fig:inconsistency-farris}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Inconsistency in branch length estimation}

We now consider the problem of branch length estimation on the correct tree using joint estimation.
As described above, we use the notion of fidelities to analyze what happens as changes occur along each branch as opposed to the standard branch length formulation.
We analyze two settings on the InvFels tree, corresponding to whether some branch fidelities are fixed at their true values or not.
As above, assume that data is generated from the InvFels tree with two top branches of fidelity $x^*$ and all other branches of fidelity $y^*$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}).

In the general case, we do the same but with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:general-bl-opt}
(\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{w}) = \arg\max_{x,y,w} \ \ell_{\tau_1,t^*}(\tau_1, \{x,y,x,y,w\})
\end{equation}
to find a region where the inferred values do not converge to the generating values.
In the Appendix we consider a ``restricted'' case where we show that, for a nontrivial subset of possible values for $x^*$ and $y^*$, the interior branch fidelity parameter $w$ will be consistently overestimated as exactly equal to one (zero branch length) instead of its true value of $y^*$.
That is, if we estimate $x$ and $y$ correctly, then, for
\[
\hat{w} = \arg\max_{w} \ \ell_{\tau_1,t^*}(\tau_1, \{x^*,y^*,x^*,y^*,w\}),
\]
there is a set of values for $x^*$ and $y^*$ where $\hat{w}\equiv 1$.
These situations are in contrast to the approach using marginal likelihood where $\hat{w}$ necessarily converges to $y^*$ as the number of observations grows \citep{RoyChoudhury2015-ta}.

%Looking to the previous section, the region where $\hat{w}=1$ will still be given by the inequality in Theorem~\ref{thm:restricted-bl}, only with $\gamma$ and $\beta$ now being functions of $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ instead of $x^*$ and $y^*$.
%We show there are similar bounds as in the restricted case, though we need to take into account the unknown values of $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$.
The estimate $\hat{w}$ in \eqref{eq:general-bl-opt} is a function of $x^*$, $y^*$, $\hat{x}$, and $\hat{y}$.
Assume we know $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ as functions of $x^*$ and $y^*$.
We fix bounds on these estimates and show that, in optimizing \eqref{eq:general-bl-opt}, joint estimation either estimates $\hat{w}$ to be one or estimates $\hat{x}$ or $\hat{y}$ to fall outside of specified bounds, indicating a poor estimate in at least one of the three unknown branch parameters.
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{generalBranchInconsist}
\label{thm:general-bl}
Define
\[
\gamma(x, y) = 4xy,
\]
\[
\beta(x, y) = 1+x^2+y^2+x^2y^2,
\]
and bounds
\[
\gamma_L := \gamma_{L}(x^*, y^*) \le \gamma(\hat{x}, \hat{y}),
\]
\[
\gamma_U := \gamma_{U}(x^*, y^*) \ge \gamma(\hat{x}, \hat{y}),
\]
and
\[
\beta_L := \beta_{L}(x^*, y^*) \le \beta(\hat{x}, \hat{y}).
\]
Assume $\hat{x}\neq 0,\hat{y}\neq 0,$ $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ are not both simultaneously one, and $x^*$ and $y^*$ are not both simultaneously zero.
Then, the maximum likelihood value $\hat{w}=1$ when
\[
-\gamma_{U}^2\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\left(1+(x^*)^2+(y^*)^2+(x^*)^2(y^*)^2\right)\right) + 2\gamma_{L}\beta_{L}x^*(y^*)^2 + \beta_{L}^2 \ge 0.
\]
\end{restatable}
We use this theorem to show incorrect branch parameter estimates as follows.
If we do not tolerate any error in pendant branches, we use the tightest possible bounds $\gamma_{L} = \gamma_{U} = \gamma$ and $\beta_{L} = \beta$; this corresponds to the restricted case, analyzed in the Appendix (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-inconsistency}).
For an intermediate bound, define a specified allowable level of error in estimates for $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ so that
\[
x^*-x_{L} \le \hat{x} \le x^*+x_{U}
\]
and
\[
y^*-y_{L} \le \hat{y} \le y^*+y_{U}.
\]
Then $\gamma_L, \gamma_U$ and $\beta_L$ can be derived directly from the bounds on $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$.
As an example, the region to the left side of the curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-loose-inconsistency} shows the case where $x_L=x_U=y_L=y_U=0.1$.
In this case, joint inference will either estimate $\hat{w}$ to have fidelity one or estimate either $\hat{x}$ or $\hat{y}$ to be more than $0.1$ away from its true fidelity.

We provide the following as an intuition for the theoretical development.
For a particular site pattern, in obtaining the joint maximum likelihood function we maximize over ancestral states.
For the internal branch---the branch between the two internal nodes---we have a choice of $(1+w)$ or $(1-w)$ in each of our likelihood terms depending on which ancestral state split corresponds to the highest partial likelihood term.
A maximization procedure will more likely introduce a $(1+w)$ term than a $(1-w)$ term, though this will not be guaranteed as the maximum depends on the values of $x$ and $y$.
This tendency to include $(1+w)$ terms in the likelihood results in a positive bias of branch fidelities.
If we allow multifurcating trees in our inference, then we can think of this as another instance of converging to the wrong topology.

    As in previous plots, the shaded and white regions are loose indications of inconsistency.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Empirical validation}

Direct numerical optimization confirms our theoretically-derived bounds and provides a more detailed picture compared to the conservative analytically-derived region (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-loose-inconsistency}).
To determine how conservative, we use the method of basin-hopping \citep{Wales1997} to perform joint estimation (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}).
We see that the region of inconsistency in the general case is similar to that of the restricted case (compare Figs.~\ref{fig:bl-inconsistency} and~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}).
This region encompasses the majority of the branch fidelity space; even given the correct topology and performing our best possible optimization, we have many situations where we will estimate the interior branch fidelity to be one.

We provide a full description of our optimization procedure in the Appendix, but briefly, we perform two maximizations---one over $0 \le x,y,w \le 1$ and one over $0 \le x,y \le 1$ with $w=1$---and take the value of $\hat{w}$ with the higher objective function.
We compute these maxima over a lattice in steps of $10^{-2}$ for $x^*$ and $y^*$ from $10^{-2}$ to $1-10^{-2}$.
We do not include zero or one in our lattice to further stabilize the fits, as these cases can result in pathologies.
Our optimization code can be found at \url{https://github.com/matsengrp/joint-inf/}.

As data were generated with parameters $\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$, the true value for $w$ is $y^*$.
Marginal inference performs as expected, where $\hat{w}$ is equal to $y^*$ regardless of the value of $x^*$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-marginal}) when optimizing \eqref{eq:marginal_likelihood} using the same procedure.
For joint inference, the estimates for $\hat{w}$ when $x^*$ and $y^*$ are both large look reasonable, with $\hat{w}$ increasing as $y^*$ increases, though Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-bias} shows there is a systematic positive bias in this procedure even when $\hat{w}$ is not estimated to be one.
To understand the quality of each fit, we report the range of $\hat{w}-y^*$ where $\hat{w}\neq 1$.
For joint inference, the errors range from $[-7\times 10^{-3}, 8\times 10^{-2}]$ and for marginal inference, $[-8\times 10^{-8}, 5\times 10^{-7}]$ showing that, even in cases where joint inference does not estimate $\hat{w}$ to be exactly one, it still fails to achieve a low error from truth.

\section*{Discussion}

We have shown that jointly inferring ancestral states and phylogenetic parameters \citep{Sagulenko2017-jo} is not consistent in general.
Specifically, in the case of four-taxon trees with infinite data, we have obtained nontrivial regions of generating parameters that result in two types of inconsistency: first, where joint inference converges on the incorrect topology and, second, where it estimates severely biased branch lengths even given the correct topology.
In all cases, these regions of inconsistency arise when the branches of the generating trees are ``long,'' that is, when branch fidelities tend to be small.
This inconsistency in the case of long branches concurs with some empirical findings in \citet{Sagulenko2017-jo}, namely their Figures~2 and 3.
\citet{Sagulenko2017-jo} explicitly warn their approximation is only valid for ``short'' branches, though Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-bias} shows even when branches are short there is a consistent bias.

Joint inference of tree parameters and ancestral sequences is a type of profile likelihood, a well-studied subject in statistics \citep{Murphy2000-ry}.
Many properties regarding the performance of maximum likelihood estimates obtained using this approach are known, and many methods exist to overcome their undesirable properties, e.g., the method of sieves \citep{Geman1982}.
A potential solution in this case using the method of sieves could be to project the column-wise ancestral state patterns into a lower-dimensional space, allowing the degrees of freedom in the ancestral state columns to grow with $\nCols$, albeit more slowly than $O(\nCols)$.
Elsewhere in statistics literature, the failure of maximum likelihood estimates to obtain consistent estimates as the number of parameters goes to infinity have been shown by the Neyman-Scott paradox \citep{Neyman1948-tt}, though parameters tending to infinity is not a necessary condition for inconsistency \citep{LeCam1990}.
Consistency proofs of standard maximum likelihood estimates of phylogeny \eqref{eq:marginal_likelihood} are recent \citep{Allman2008-wd,Chai2011-ff,RoyChoudhury2015-ta}, and no results have been obtained for profile likelihood.
We have furthered progress in understanding the limitations of this joint optimization procedure.

Previous work in phylogenetics has developed consistency counterexamples using the same four-taxon topologies used here \citep{Felsenstein1978-rr}.
In this previous work, when simulating data under the Felsenstein topology $\tau_2$, as the number of observations increases, the InvFels topology $\tau_1$ becomes more likely when performing a particular estimation procedure.
This is the converse of what we have shown for joint inference, where the Felsenstein topology is more likely than the InvFels topology.
Moreover, the inconsistency demonstrated by \citet{Felsenstein1978-rr} is attributed to long branch attraction, i.e., the fact that there may be multiple long branches where parallel changes are more likely than a single change along a short branch.
This is not the case here; for our case, the inconsistency generally occurs when all branches are long, and has more to do with the choices of the form of the likelihood than from the interplay of long and short branches.
Difficulties in phylogenetic estimation when generating data on the InvFels tree have been found by \citet{Siddall1998-hq}, though \citet{Swofford2001-hr} show that sequence length plays a major role in these issues.

%EM Let's set a time in the first half of this week for you to walk me through the Goldman paper and this paragraph. Thanks!
The case of joint inference of a phylogenetic likelihood was discussed in \citet{Goldman1990-dk}.
In it, Goldman provides a worked example in which estimating a topology with fixed branch lengths is equivalent to parsimony and thus not guaranteed to be consistent, though he does not discuss the inconsistency of joint inference in general.
We show cases where the estimates of the topology will be inconsistent if we are estimating both topology and branch lengths, and, moreover, even if we know the correct topology, we show cases where branch lengths will also be inconsistent.
Finally, just prior to his conclusion, he discusses when parsimony will give the same answer as maximum likelihood, concluding that the question is ill-posed since parsimony estimates different parameters than maximum likelihood, i.e., it assumes equal branch lengths.
The joint inference procedure outlined here estimates the same parameters as classical maximum likelihood, rendering the question well-posed.
Finally, we are able to provide much more detail on how large branch lengths must be for general joint inference---estimating topology and branch lengths together---to fail to be consistent.

While we have shown inconsistency in both topology and branch parameter estimation, there is substantial scope for future work to make these results more precise and more general.
The techniques used to obtain upper and lower bounds for the likelihoods in the topology estimation case provide relatively loose bounds, though how loose they are remain unknown without either further analysis or verification through simulation.
Similarly, for the general case in estimating branch lengths, we were only able to provide a conservative region of overestimation, and the unusual shape we observe via numerical optimization (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}) begs further investigation.
Empirical validation shows that the general case is not unlike the restricted case.
All of these results hold only for a simple binary symmetric model on four-taxon trees, and extensive simulation is necessary to understand how these results extend to more complicated general cases.
Given that many of the bounds presented here are in the form of level sets of multivariate polynomials, a more formal approach using algebraic geometric techniques may reveal more stable or interesting patterns of inconsistency; see \citet{Sturmfels2002} for a thorough treatment of solving systems of polynomial equations.
Finally, all of the material presented here concerns joint estimation under maximum likelihood, and does not pose any problem for other settings, such as joint sampling of trees and ancestral sequences in a Bayesian framework.
