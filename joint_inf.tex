\section*{Introduction}

Classical maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation in phylogenetics operates by integrating out possible ancestral states at the internal nodes of the tree.
Recently, \cite{Sagulenko2017-jo} have suggested using an approximation to ML inference in which the likelihood is maximized jointly across model parameters and ancestral sequences.
This is attractive from a computational perspective: such joint ML inference can proceed according to an iterative procedure in which ML ancestral sequences are first inferred and then model parameters are optimized conditional on the ancestral sequences.
This latter conditional optimization is simpler and more computationally efficient than marginalizing out ancestral sequences and then performing optimization.

Existing consistency proofs for maximum-likelihood phylogenetics \cite{RoyChoudhury2015-ta} apply only to estimating model parameters when the ancestral sequences have been integrated out of the likelihood.
These proofs do not readily extend to include estimating ancestral states.
Moreover, examples of inconsistency arising from including a large number of additional parameters \cite{Neyman1948-tt} indicate that joint inference of trees and ancestral states may not enjoy good statistical properties.
Although \cite{Sagulenko2017-jo} explicitly warn that their approximation is for the case of branch lengths $\ll 1$ and limit themselves to optimizing branch lengths using this method, their work motivates understanding when exactly this approximation breaks down, and what happens when we optimize branch lengths and tree topology using this approximation.

In this paper, we show that the joint inference of trees and ancestral sequences is not consistent in general.
To do so, we use a binary symmetric model and imagine data being generated on the four taxon ``Farris zone'' \cite{Siddall1998-hq} tree, and we construct bounds on the joint likelihood to demarcate a sizeable area of long branch lengths in which joint inference is guaranteed to give the wrong tree in the limit of infinite data.
We find similar areas where joint inference consistently overestimates interior branch lengths when the topology is known.

\section*{Phylogenetic maximum likelihood}

Assume the binary symmetric model, namely with a character alphabet $\alphabet=\{0,1\}$ and a uniform stationary distribution.
%das: @EM is there a good reference to binary symmetric model, or should we trot out the definition and all implications/corollaries of it? I guess it depends where we'd submit?
Let $\nSiteRows$ be the number of tips of the tree, and $\nAncestralStateRows = \nSiteRows-2$ the number of internal nodes.
We observe $\nCols$ samples of character data, i.e., an alignment with $\nCols$ columns, $\fullAlignment=[\alignmentColumn_1,\ldots,\alignmentColumn_\nCols]\in\alphabet^{\nSiteRows\times\nCols}$ distributed as the random variable $\alignmentColumnRV$.
The corresponding unobserved ancestral states are $\fullAncestralStates=[\ancestralStateColumn_1,\ldots,\ancestralStateColumn_\nCols]\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows\times\nCols}$ and distributed as $\ancestralStateColumnRV$.

We parameterize branches on the unique unrooted four-tip phylogenetic tree in ways known as the ``Farris'' and ``Felsenstein'' trees (Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}).
In the classical configuration of each of these topologies, the interior branch length parameters are equal to the bottom two parameters.
We show in the Appendix that, in the case of the Farris tree, fixing both the top two branch parameters to be equal and the bottom two branch parameters to be equal will obtain the same maximum likelihood estimate as in the case of arbitrary branch parameters.

%EM Wouldn't it be better to just parameterize these with x,y,w without primes? Also, it looks super pro if we can use tex fonts in this figure too. I love the mathjax fonts, which I think you can get https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/fonts/fonts-mathjax . LMK if you run into trouble. The font I use is "MathJax_Math".
%das: I think I'm either going to go with something other than the primes, like z_1, z_2, z_3, or replace x and y with greek letters or whatever, but it'll be a little bit of a tedious edit.
%EM You mean globally in the whole document? Let's kick around ideas if so.
%das: I think we just need the true generating parameters---x^* and y^*---and the estimands---x', y', w'. I've been bad about using x and y instead of x^* and y^* for function arguments because it's cleaner, and I think there is inconsistency in using the primes and not. How about Greek for unknown (truth) and Latin for estimands? \alpha and \beta for generating parameters and x, y, z for estimands? Would have to change some other notation but shouldn't be too hard I hope.

\end{figure}

We parameterize the branches of these trees not with the standard notion of branch length in terms of number of substitutions per site, but with a parameter such that the probability of a substitution on a branch with parameter $\theta$ is $p_\theta = (1-\theta)/2$ while the probability of no substitution is $(1+\theta)/2$ where $0 \le \theta \le 1$.
We follow \cite{Matsen2007-jq} in calling this edge ``fidelity'' as it quantifies the fidelity of transmission of the ancestral state along an edge.
Fidelities have useful algebraic properties, and generating probabilities using the Hadamard transform have an especially simple form (see either 8.6 of Semple and Steel \cite{Semple2003-em} or \eqref{eq:hadamard_probability} in the Appendix).

\subsection*{Two paths to maximum likelihood}

The standard phylogenetic likelihood approach on unrooted trees under the usual assumption of independence between sites is as follows.
For a topology $\tau$ and branch fidelities $t$ the likelihood given observed ancestral states $\fullAncestralStates$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:full_likelihood}
L_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment,\fullAncestralStates) = \prod_{i=1}^{\nCols} \ \Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t).
\end{equation}
The probability $\Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t)$ is a product of transition probabilities determined by $\fullAlignment$, $\fullAncestralStates$, $\tau$, and $t$ \cite{Felsenstein2004}.

The typical approach to is to maximize the likelihood marginalized across ancestral states
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:marginal_likelihood}
\tilde{L}_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) = \sum_{\fullAncestralStates\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows\times\nCols}} \ L_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment, \fullAncestralStates)
\end{equation}
to estimate the tree $\tau$ and branch fidelities $t$.

An alternative approach \cite{Sagulenko2017-jo} does away with the marginalization and directly estimates the maximum likelihood parameters of the fully\hyp{}observed likelihood in \eqref{eq:full_likelihood}.
This is known as a profile likelihood \cite{Murphy2000-ry}, which exists here because $\alphabet$ is a finite set:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profile_likelihood}
L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) = \max_{\fullAncestralStates\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows\times\nCols}} \ L_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment, \fullAncestralStates).
\end{equation}
%EM Does this have to be unique? Can we just say "denote an estimate"?
%das: what does this refer to? the deleted sentence about the alphabet being discrete? I had that in just to show that there will be a maximum---i.e., no degeneracy---but maybe it's not necessary.
%EM Damn, sorry to be unclear. The following statement says "denote THE estimate" which makes the ancestral state sound unique. Are you saying that it is? It's not obvious to me.
%das: ah, got it. It's not unique, and why we needed the $\eta$s; hopefully "an" is better than "the?"
We will use $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}$ to denote an estimate for $\fullAncestralStates$ obtained by maximization \eqref{eq:profile_likelihood}.
One can then estimate a topology and branch fidelities using this profile likelihood:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profile_likelihood_topology_bl}
(\hat{\tau}, \hat{t}) = \argmax_{\tau, t} \ L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment).
\end{equation}
In general, the functional form of \eqref{eq:profile_likelihood} is determined by inequalities that depend on the unknown $(\tau,t)$.
For this reason, in practice, the joint ML strategy estimates $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}$ for a fixed $(\tau,t)$, then $(\hat{\tau},\hat{t})$ given $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}$, maximizing each of these conditional objectives until convergence \cite{Sagulenko2017-jo}.


\section*{Inconsistency of joint inference}

We can now state our results on inconsistency of joint inference.
All proofs are deferred to the Appendix.

Assume $\fullAlignment$ is generated from topology $\tau^*$ and branch fidelities $t^*$.
Define $\ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau, t)$ such that
$$
\frac{1}{n}\log L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) \rightarrow \ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau, t).
$$
We give $\ell$ explicitly in \eqref{eq:site_pattern_profile_likelihood_mean} in the Appendix.
%EM I think that this is a technicality. I propose that we just state that we can restrict to the parameterization shown in the figure (with certain branch lengths equal) and that a formal statement and proof is in the appendix.
%EM :) I think that we can make this even simpler by skipping the following statement and cutting straight to "fixing both the top two branch lengths..."

\subsection*{Inconsistency in topology estimation}

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{topoInconsist}
There exist $L_0(x, y), L_1(x, y)$ and $0 < x', y' < 1$ such that
$$
\max_{t} \ \ell_{\tau_1,t^*}(\tau_1, t) \le L_0(x, y),
$$
$$
\max_{t} \ \ell_{\tau_1,t^*}(\tau_2, t) \ge L_1(x, y)
$$
and $L_1(x', y') > L_0(x', y')$.
\end{restatable}
Fig.~\ref{fig:inconsistency-farris} shows the values of $x$ and $y$ where $L_1(x, y) > L_0(x, y)$.
Intuitively, $\tau_2$ is favored in performing joint maximum likelihood since the likelihood for $\tau_2$ has more ``degrees of freedom''---Table~\ref{tab:likelihoods} shows that $\tau_1$ has only three possible forms for its likelihood while $\tau_2$ has many more.
This results in more possible maxima for $\tau_2$ even if data are generated from $\tau_1$.

    Due to the looseness of the upper and lower bounds, the parameters in the top right do not necessarily indicate consistency, though all parameters in the labeled region result in an inconsistency.
}
\label{fig:inconsistency-farris}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Inconsistency in branch fidelity estimation}

We now consider the problem of branch fidelity estimation on the correct tree using joint ancestral state and branch fidelity estimation.
We analyze two settings on the Farris topology, corresponding to whether some branch fidelities are fixed at their true values or not.
As above, assume that data is generated with two sister branches of fidelity $x$, with all other branches of fidelity $y$.
We show that, for a nontrivial subset of possible values for $x$ and $y$, the interior branch fidelity parameter $w'$ will be consistently overestimated as exactly equal to one instead of its true value of $y$.
That is, for the restricted case, with
$$
\hat{w}' = \arg\max_{w'} \ \ell_{\tau_1,\{x,y,y\}}(\tau_1, \{x,y,w'\}),
$$
we show there are values for $x$ and $y$ where $\hat{w}'\equiv 1$.
In the general case, we do the same but with
$$
(\hat{x}', \hat{y}', \hat{w}') = \arg\max_{x',y',w'} \ \ell_{\tau_1,\{x,y,y\}}(\tau_1, \{x',y',w'\}).
$$
These situations are in contrast to the approach using marginal likelihood where necessarily $\hat{w}'=y$.

\subsubsection*{Restricted case}

Fix $x'=x$ and $y'=y$ to their true, generating values and proceed to estimate the internal branch parameter $w'$.
Let
$$
\alpha_1 := \alpha_1(x, y) = \frac{1}{8} \left(1+x^2+y^2+4xy^2+x^2y^2\right),
$$
$$
\alpha_2 := \alpha_2(x, y) = \frac{1}{8}\left(1+x^2+y^2-4xy^2+x^2y^2\right),
$$
$$
\beta := \beta(x, y) = 1+x^2+y^2+x^2y^2,
$$
$$
\gamma := \gamma(x, y) = 4xy.
$$
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{restrictedBranchInconsist}
\label{thm:restricted-bl}
The maximum likelihood value $\hat{w}' = 1$ if
$$
\beta^2-\gamma^2-2\gamma^2\alpha_1-2\gamma^2\alpha_2+2\gamma\alpha_1\beta-2\gamma\alpha_2\beta \ge 0.
$$
\end{restatable}
The inequality in Theorem~\ref{thm:restricted-bl} is a function of the generating parameters $x$ and $y$.
This region is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-inconsistency}.

\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{branch-length-inconsistency-inkscape}
\caption{Region of inconsistency with $x$ and $y$ fixed.}
\label{fig:bl-inconsistency}
\end{figure}

Intuitively, since we perform maximization over internal states, branch fidelities will have a tendency to be overestimated.
Seeing no change along a branch more likely increases the likelihood by introducing a term of $(1+\theta)$ instead of $(1-\theta)$, and branch fidelities will be positively biased due to this.

\subsubsection*{General case}

In the general case, $\hat{w}'$ is a function of $x$, $y$, $\hat{x}'$, and $\hat{y}'$.
Looking to the previous section, $\hat{w}'$ is still given by the quadratic formula, only with $\gamma$ and $\beta$ now being functions of $\hat{x}'$ and $\hat{y}'$ instead of $x$ and $y$.
Assume we know $\hat{x}'$ and $\hat{y}'$ as functions of $x$ and $y$ only.
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{generalBranchInconsist}
\label{thm:general-bl}
For
$$
\gamma_{L}(x, y) \le \gamma(\hat{x}', \hat{y}') \le \gamma_{U}(x, y)
$$
and
$$
\beta_{L}(x, y) \le \beta(\hat{x}', \hat{y}'),
$$
the maximum likelihood value $\hat{w}=1$ when
$$
-\gamma_{U}^2(x, y)\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\beta(x, y)\right) + 2\gamma_{L}(x, y)\beta_{L}(x, y)xy^2 + \beta_{L}^2(x, y) \ge 0.
$$
\end{restatable}
Similar to Theorem~\ref{thm:restricted-bl}, the inequality in Theorem~\ref{thm:general-bl} is also a function of only $x$ and $y$.
The loosest possible bounds are $\gamma_{L} = 0$, $\beta_{L} = 1$ and $\gamma_{U} = 4$, giving
$$
-16\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\beta(x, y)\right) + 1 \ge 0,
$$
which is never true.
The tightest possible bounds are $\gamma_{L} = \gamma_{U} = \gamma(x, y)$ and $\beta_{L} = \beta(x, y)$, which is the case in Figure~\ref{fig:bl-inconsistency}.
As an example middle case, let the error in estimating both $\hat{x}'$ and $\hat{y}'$ be $0.1$ in either direction, i.e.,
$$
x-0.1\le\hat{x}'\le x+0.1,
$$
$$
y-0.1\le\hat{y}'\le y+0.1.
$$
In this case, the region to the left side of the curve in Figure~\ref{fig:bl-loose-inconsistency} will either estimate $\hat{w}'$ to be one or estimate either $\hat{x}'$ or $\hat{y}'$ to be more than $0.1$ away from its true value.

\label{fig:bl-loose-inconsistency}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Empirical validation}

The region of inconsistency in Figure~\ref{fig:bl-loose-inconsistency} is a conservative estimate of where $\hat{w}=1$.
To determine how conservative, we use the method of differential evolution \cite{Storn1997} to perform joint maximum likelihood estimation using numerical optimization.
Since empirical estimates can be unstable, we perform two maximizations---one over $0 \le x',y',w' \le 1$ and one over $0 \le x',y' \le 1$ with $w'=1$---and take the value of $\hat{w}'$ with the higher likelihood.
%EM XXXX below because no bio journals have numbered sections.
%das: what should we do you think? I ran into this with the hadamard transform and went with the equation number instead of section, but not sure what to do here.
%EM In fact I wasn't even sure exactly to what you were referring when the section number was in there. It doesn't seem to me to need a whole lot of justification though.
We compute these maxima over a lattice in steps of $10^{-3}$ for $x$ and $y$ from $10^{-3}$ to $1-10^{-3}$---we do not include zero or one in our lattice to further stabilize the fits, as these cases can result in pathologies.
From this process we obtain Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}.

The estimates for $\hat{w}'$ when $x$ and $y$ are both large seem to be unbiased, with $\hat{w}'$ increasing as $y$ increases, though the region where $\hat{w}'$ is estimated to be one---indicating no change along that particular branch---is similar to that in the restricted case.
Although the restricted and general case are similar, comparing Figures~\ref{fig:bl-inconsistency} and~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency} shows that the region of inconsistency in the general case has a slightly different character, possibly due to potential looseness of the bound in the restricted case.
%das: TODO double check this; do the same empirical plot for the restricted case
This region encompasses the majority of the parameter space; even given the correct Farris topology and performing our best possible optimization, we have a region of the space of true parameters where we will always estimate the interior branch parameter to be one.

\section*{Discussion}

The method of profile likleihood is well-studied \cite{Murphy2000-ry}.
Many properties regarding the performance of maximum likelihood estimates obtained using this approach are known \cite{Geman1982}, and joint inference of phylogenetic parameters and ancestral states \cite{Sagulenko2017-jo} is a similar approach to profile likelihood.
Elsewhere in statistics literature, undesirable properties of maximum likelihood estimates in the case of infinite parameters have been shown by the Neyman-Scott paradox \cite{Neyman1948-tt}, though the fact of parameters tending to infinity is not necessarily the reason for inconsistency \cite{LeCam1990}.
Until recently \cite{RoyChoudhury2015-ta}, results on the properties of standard maximum likelihood estimates of phylogeny as in \eqref{eq:marginal_likelihood} have been difficult to prove, and no results have been obtained for profile likelihood.
We have furthered progress to understand the limitations of this joint maximum likelihood approach in the case of phylogenetics.

In phylogenetics, counterexamples showing methods of phylogenetic inference are inconsistent have been shown using the same four-taxa topologies used here \cite{Felsenstein1978-rr}.
In this case, the converse is shown: when simulating data under the ``Felsenstein zone'' topology $\tau_2$, as the number of observations increases, the ``Farris zone'' topology $\tau_1$ becomes more likely.
Looking at the figure in \cite{Felsenstein1978-rr}, the region in Fig.~\ref{fig:inconsistency-farris} has a similar character, albeit a smaller region.
Difficulties in phylogenetic estimation when the ``Farris zone'' generates characters is used in \cite{Siddall1998-hq}, though \cite{Swofford2001-hr} show that sequence length plays a major role in these issues.

%EM We should be clear here that thus this is not "long branch attraction". I haven't read the Farris papers, but I wonder what his argument is and if it relates to this, in that there are too many parameters. Probably something should go in the intro as well pointing out that this is not LBA.
%das: Noted. I will work on this.
%das: still not quite sure about what to say re LBA, but I'm thinking about it
%Discussion of number of parameters of each.
