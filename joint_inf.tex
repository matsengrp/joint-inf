\begin{abstract}
Maximum likelihood estimation in phylogenetics requires a means of handling unknown ancestral states.
Classical maximum likelihood averages over these unknown intermediate states, leading to consistent estimation of the topology and continuous model parameters.
Recently, a computationally-efficient approach has been proposed to jointly maximize over these unknown states and phylogenetic parameters.
Although this method of joint maximum likelihood estimation can obtain estimates more quickly, its properties as an estimator are not yet clear.
We show that this method of jointly estimating phylogenetic parameters along with ancestral states is not consistent in general.
We find a set of parameters that generate data under a four-taxon tree for which this joint method estimates a multifurcating topology in the limit of infinite-length sequences by estimating one or more branches to be zero length.
For branch length estimation on the correct topology, we show that this joint method cannot correctly estimate branch lengths except on a set of measure zero, and we show empirically that branch lengths are biased in this setting even for short branches, with bias of the same order as the branch lengths themselves.

\section*{Introduction}

Classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in phylogenetics operates by integrating out latent ancestral states at the internal nodes of the tree, obtaining an integrated likelihood \citep{Goldman1990-dk}.
In a recent paper, \citet{Sagulenko2018-xl} suggest using an approximation to ML inference in which the likelihood is maximized jointly across model parameters and ancestral sequences on a fixed topology.
This is attractive from a computational perspective: such joint inference can proceed according to an iterative procedure in which ancestral sequences are first estimated and model parameters are optimized conditional on these estimates.
This latter conditional optimization is simpler and more computationally efficient than optimizing the integrated likelihood.
But is it statistically consistent?

An estimator is said to be statistically consistent if it converges to the generating model with probability one in the large-data limit; existing consistency proofs for maximum likelihood phylogenetics \citep{Allman2008-wd,Chai2011-ff,RoyChoudhury2015-ta} apply only to estimating model parameters when the ancestral sequences have been integrated out of the likelihood.
These proofs do not readily extend to include estimating ancestral states.
Moreover, examples of inconsistency arising from problems where the number of parameters increases with the amount of data \citep{Neyman1948-tt} indicate that joint inference of trees and ancestral states may not enjoy good statistical properties.
In this case those additional parameters are the states of ancestral sequences.
%page 2 section 2.1 at the top of the second column first paragraph second sentence
Although \citet{Sagulenko2018-xl} explicitly warn that the approximation is for the case where ``branch lengths are short and only a minority of sites change on a given branch,'' their work motivates understanding the general properties of such joint inference.
In particular, one would like to know when this approximate technique breaks down for both topology and branch length inference, even when sequence data is ``perfect,'' i.e., is generated without sampling error according to the exact model used for inference.

In this paper, we show that jointly inferring trees and ancestral sequences is not consistent in general.
To do so, we use a binary symmetric model with data generated on a four-taxon tree: we compute closed form solutions to the joint objective function and demarcate a sizeable area of branch lengths in which joint inference is guaranteed to give a multifurcating tree in the case of perfect sequence data with an infinite number of sites by estimating one or more branch lengths to be exactly zero.
We show that, when the topology is known and fixed, joint inference for branch length estimation cannot be consistent except on a set of measure zero (i.e.\ a set that occupies zero volume in parameter space).
Empirically, we find areas where joint inference consistently underestimates interior branch lengths, including regions of short branch length where bias is on the same order as the branch length.

\section*{Phylogenetic maximum likelihood}

Assume the binary symmetric model, namely with a character alphabet $\alphabet=\{0,1\}$ and a uniform stationary distribution \citep{Semple2003-em}.
Let $\nSiteRows$ be the number of tips of the tree, and $\nAncestralStateRows = \nSiteRows-2$ be the number of internal nodes.
We observe $\nCols$ independent and identically distributed samples of character data, i.e., an alignment with $\nCols$ columns, $\fullAlignment=[\alignmentColumn_1,\ldots,\alignmentColumn_\nCols]\in\alphabet^{\nSiteRows\times\nCols}$ distributed as the random variable $\alignmentColumnRV$.
The corresponding unobserved ancestral states are $\fullAncestralStates=[\ancestralStateColumn_1,\ldots,\ancestralStateColumn_\nCols]\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows\times\nCols}$ and distributed as $\ancestralStateColumnRV$ with each $\ancestralStateColumn_i\in\alphabet^\nAncestralStateRows$.

We parameterize branches on the unique unrooted four-tip phylogenetic tree in ways known as the ``inverse Felsenstein (InvFels)'' tree (Figs.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}a and~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}b) and the ``Felsenstein'' tree (Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}c).
The ``inverse Felsenstein'' terminology comes from \citet{Swofford2001-hr}, although it is also called the ``Farris'' tree \citep{Siddall1998-hq, Felsenstein2004}.
In the standard configuration of this tree, the interior branch parameters are equal to the bottom two parameters as in Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}a.
We use this standard configuration as our data generating process, though we do not constrain our branch parameters to be equal when optimizing our objective function.

\caption{Three four-taxon trees with fidelities as labeled.}
\label{fig:farris-fels-top}
\end{figure}

We parameterize the branches of these trees not with the standard notion of branch length in terms of number of substitutions per site, but with an alternate formulation called ``fidelity.''
The probability of a substitution on a branch with fidelity $x$ is $(1-x)/2$, while the probability of no substitution is $(1+x)/2$ where $0 \le x \le 1$.
This parameter quantifies the fidelity of transmission of the ancestral state across an edge \citep{Matsen2007-jq}.

Fidelities have useful algebraic properties.
As data becomes plentiful, we use the Hadamard transform (see \eqref{eq:hadamard_probability} in the Appendix) to compute the exact probabilities that generate each particular configuration of taxa---we call these ``generating probabilities''---and these have an especially simple form.
For a four-taxon tree, define the general branch fidelity parameter $t=\{x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,w\}$ where fidelities are ordered in the order of the taxa with the internal branch last (Figs.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}b and~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}c).
Although we use fidelities exclusively for our theoretical development, we have made our figures in terms of probabilities of substitution $p_{x} = (1-x)/2$ as they are easier to interpret.

\subsection*{Two paths to maximum likelihood}

The standard phylogenetic likelihood approach on unrooted trees under the usual assumption of independence between sites is as follows.
For a topology $\tau$ and branch fidelities $t$ the likelihood given observed ancestral states $\fullAncestralStates$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:full_likelihood}
L_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment,\fullAncestralStates) = \prod_{i=1}^{\nCols} \ \Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t).
\end{equation}
The probability $\Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t)$ is a product of transition probabilities determined by $\fullAlignment$, $\fullAncestralStates$, $\tau$, and $t$ \citep{Felsenstein2004}.

The classical approach is to maximize the likelihood marginalized across ancestral states
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:marginal_likelihood}
\tilde{L}_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) = \prod_{i=1}^{\nCols} \ \sum_{\ancestralStateColumn_i\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows}} \ \Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t)
\end{equation}
to estimate the tree $\tau$ and branch fidelities $t$.

The alternative approach \citep{Sagulenko2018-xl} does away with the marginalization and directly estimates the maximum likelihood parameters of the fully-observed likelihood in \eqref{eq:full_likelihood}.
This is known in statistics as a profile likelihood \citep{Murphy2000-ry} or a relative likelihood \citep{Goldman1990-dk}, which exists here because $\alphabet$ is a finite set:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profile_likelihood}
L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) = \prod_{i=1}^{\nCols} \ \max_{\ancestralStateColumn_i\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows}} \ \Pr(\alignmentColumnRV=\alignmentColumn_i, \ancestralStateColumnRV=\ancestralStateColumn_i \mid \tau, t) = \max_{\fullAncestralStates\in\alphabet^{\nAncestralStateRows\times\nCols}} \ L_\nCols(\tau, t; \fullAlignment, \fullAncestralStates).
\end{equation}
We use $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}_\nCols$ to denote an estimate for $\fullAncestralStates$ obtained by maximizing \eqref{eq:profile_likelihood}, and estimate a topology and branch fidelities using this profile likelihood as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profile_likelihood_topology_bl}
(\hat{\tau}_\nCols, \hat{t}_\nCols) = \argmax_{\tau, t} \ L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment).
\end{equation}
In general, the functional form of \eqref{eq:profile_likelihood} is determined by inequalities arising from taking maxima over ancestral states (Table~\ref{tab:farris_likelihoods}) to obtain each conditional likelihood term, these terms depending on the unknown $(\tau, t)$.
For this reason, in practice, the joint inference strategy estimates $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}_\nCols$ for a fixed $(\tau,t)$, then $(\hat{\tau}_\nCols,\hat{t}_\nCols)$ given $\hat{\fullAncestralStates}_\nCols$, maximizing each of these conditional objectives until convergence \citep{Sagulenko2018-xl}.


\section*{Inconsistency of joint inference}

We now state our results on the inconsistency of joint inference.
All proofs are deferred to the Appendix.

Assume $\fullAlignment$ is generated from the InvFels topology $\tau^*$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:farris-fels-top}a) and with true generating branch fidelities $t^*=\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$.
Let $\boldsymbol\xi = [\xi_j]_{j=1}^\nSiteSplits$ be the vector of most likely ancestral state splits---the explicit definition for $\boldsymbol\xi$ is given in the Appendix.
Use $\ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau, t; \boldsymbol\xi)$ to denote the expected per-site log-likelihood, which can be thought of as the infinite-length sequence case because, as shown in the Appendix,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp-log-lik}
\frac{1}{n}\log L_\nCols'(\tau, t; \fullAlignment) \rightarrow \ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau, t; \boldsymbol\xi).
\end{equation}
We give $\ell$ explicitly as \eqref{eq:site_pattern_profile_likelihood_mean} in the Appendix.
For a fixed $\tau$, let $\hat{t}_\nCols$ maximize the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:exp-log-lik} and $\hat{t}$ maximize the right-hand side.
We show in the Appendix that $\hat{t}_\nCols \rightarrow \hat{t}$, allowing us to focus on only the right-hand side above.

%We show that, as $\nCols\rightarrow\infty$, there exist values for $x^*$ and $y^*$ such that the value of the likelihood after maximizing using joint inference is greater for the Felsenstein topology ($\tau_2$) than for the true, generating InvFels topology ($\tau_1$).
%To do so, we construct an upper bound $C_0(x^*, y^*)$ for the likelihood given the InvFels topology as a function of $x^*$ and $y^*$ and, similarly, a lower bound $C_1(x^*, y^*)$ for the likelihood given the Felsenstein topology.
%When $C_0(x^*, y^*) < C_1(x^*, y^*)$, the likelihood in the Felsenstein case is larger than the likelihood in the InvFels case, demonstrating inconsistency (Fig.~\ref{fig:inconsistency-farris}).

\subsection*{Inconsistent branch parameter estimation}
When the topology is known and fixed and we estimate only the branch parameters, we show that for almost all generating parameter values, any branch parameter estimate is consistently biased.
For the branch parameter, we use branch fidelities (discussed earlier) in all statements and proofs, though these trivially extend to branch lengths via transformation.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{blInconsist}
\label{thm:bl_theorem}
Let $\tau^*=\tau_1$, $t^*=\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$, and $t=\{x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, w\}$ with $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, w > 0$.
For $0 < x^*, y^* < 1$, the solution $\hat{t} := \{\hat{x}_1,\hat{y}_1,\hat{x}_2,\hat{y}_2,\hat{w}\}$ given by
\[
\hat{t} = \arg\max_{t} \ \max_{\boldsymbol\xi} \ \ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau_1, t; \boldsymbol\xi)
\]
has the property that $\hat{t} \neq t^*$ everywhere except a set of measure zero.
\end{restatable}

In words, the joint estimation procedure does not recover the true generating $t^*$ almost everywhere in the space of generating parameters.
The proof can be seen intuitively through the fact that the estimator for a given branch fidelity cannot isolate the individual generating parameter as a linear term since the estimator itself is a combination of nonlinear functions (in $(x^*,y^*)$) of generating fidelities.
For example, in estimating $x_1$, $\hat{x}_1$ is a linear combination of $p_{\siteSplit_j}$ values.
For the generating probabilities (top panel of Table~\ref{tab:gen-sitepatprob}), there is no linear combination that results in an isolated $x^*$ term, as all terms are either quadratic, i.e., $(x^*)^2$ or $(x^*)^2(y^*)^2$, or have both $x^*$ and $y^*$, i.e., $x^*(y^*)^2$.
Thus, we cannot obtain a linear combination that in the general case yields $x^*$.
We may have special cases where certain $x^*$ and $y^*$ values yield consistent estimates for $\hat{t}$, but consistency does not hold in general.
We give an example of consistency in a degenerate case in the Appendix following the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:bl_theorem}.

\subsection*{Convergence to the degenerate topology}
Given data generated on $\tau_1$ there exist true nonzero branch lengths such that the estimator $\hat{t}$ maximizing the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:exp-log-lik} has an internal branch of length zero.
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{topoInconsist}
\label{thm:topo_theorem}
Let $\tau^*=\tau_1$, $t^*=\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$, and $t=\{x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, w\}$ with $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, w > 0$.
There exists an open set of $0 < x^*, y^* < 1$ such that the solution $\hat{t} := \{\hat{x}_1,\hat{y}_1,\hat{x}_2,\hat{y}_2,\hat{w}\}$ given by
\[
\hat{t} = \arg\max_{t} \ \max_{\boldsymbol\xi} \ \ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau_1, t; \boldsymbol\xi)
\]
has the property $\hat{w}\equiv 1$.
\end{restatable}

This result implies an inconsistency as we estimate the interior branch length to be zero (i.e., interior branch fidelity is one) in an open set of values for $x^*$ and $y^*$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}).
As we consider different topologies $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ for $\hat{t}$, the incorrect topology $\tau_2$ attains a likelihood value at its maximum equal to that of the true topology $\tau_1$ in the limit.
In other words, if $w=1$ the objective functions $\ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau_1, t; \boldsymbol\xi)$ and $\ell_{\tau^*,t^*}(\tau_2, t; \boldsymbol\xi)$ are equivalent.
We elaborate on this point in the Appendix.
The proof is through analytically reducing the general case to 81 separate cases (Table~\ref{tab:likelihoods}) to obtain a closed form maximal value for each.

We provide the following as an intuition for the theoretical development.
For a particular site pattern, to obtain the joint maximum likelihood function we maximize over ancestral states.
For the internal branch---the branch between the two internal nodes---we have a choice of $(1+w)$ or $(1-w)$ in each of our likelihood terms depending on which ancestral state corresponds to the highest conditional log-likelihood.
As $(1+w) > (1-w)$, a maximization procedure tends to prefer the $(1+w)$ term, though this is not guaranteed because the maximum depends on the values of the unknown branch parameters $t$.
Nevertheless, this tendency to include $(1+w)$ terms in the likelihood results in a positive bias of branch fidelities, i.e., estimating branch lengths to be shorter than truth.
This is apparent in the ``long $x^*$, short $y^*$'' scenario as these are the cases in which the most likely ancestral states are the same for each internal node letting $x_1=x_2=x^*$ and $y_1=y_2=y^*$ ($\xi_j=\emptyset$ for all $j$ in Table~\ref{tab:likelihoods}).
If we allow multifurcating trees in our inference, then we can think of this as an instance of converging to the wrong topology, as the true $y^*\neq 1$.

\subsubsection*{Empirical validation}

Direct numerical optimization confirms our theoretically-derived bounds and provides a more detailed picture compared to the analytically\hyp{}derived region (Fig.~\ref{fig:max-anc-state}).
To verify the regions of inconsistency and obtain a clearer picture of the closed form parameter estimates, we plot the optimal $\hat{w}$ via joint estimation (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}).
As before, the region of inconsistency encompasses almost half of the branch fidelity space; given the correct topology, there are many situations where we estimate the interior branch length to be zero.

\begin{figure}

    The white region in the lower right highlights which values of $x^*$ and $y^*$ result in an interior branch being estimated as length zero, resulting in an inconsistency.
}
\label{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}
\end{figure}

In our optimization procedure, we again consider the 81 separate cases (Table~\ref{tab:likelihoods}) and, for each function, we compute the closed form solution for $\hat{t}$.
We compute these maxima over a lattice in steps of $10^{-2}$ for $x^*,y^*\in(0,1)$.
Our optimization code can be found at \url{https://github.com/matsengrp/joint-inf/}.

In estimating the interior branch length $w$, we find a systematic bias in the joint inference procedure even when the true branches are short (Fig.~\ref{fig:empirical-bias}).
As data are generated with parameters $\{x^*, y^*, x^*, y^*, y^*\}$, the true value for $w$ is $y^*$.
There are discontinuities in the fit (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}) due to the choice of which ancestral state splits are maximal, so we investigate the bias in the region where $p_{x^*}$ and $p_{y^*}$ are both small, i.e., $p_{x^*}, p_{y^*} \le .1$, as these short-branch cases should be the best settings for joint optimization \citep{Sagulenko2018-xl}.
Although the estimates for $\hat{p}_w$ are better than the estimates when $p_{y^*}$ is small and $p_{x^*}$ is large (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-inconsistency}), joint inference still predictably underestimates the interior branch length.
%EM I don't feel like this "range" is a very strong statement. What if we just repeat that the bias is of the same order as the branch lengths and give an example?
Additionally, the bias estimates $\hat{p}_w-p_{y^*}$ given $p_{x^*}, p_{y^*} \le .1$ range from $[-4\times 10^{-2}, 3\times 10^{-3}]$.
showing that even in cases where joint inference is supposed to do well, it still fails to achieve a low error from truth.

In contrast, inference on the integrated likelihood performs as expected, such that $\hat{w}$ is equal to $y^*$ regardless of the value of $x^*$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:bl-general-marginal}).
The errors in this case \eqref{eq:marginal_likelihood} via optimization with L-BFGS-B are lower than machine tolerance.

\section*{Discussion}

We have shown that jointly inferring ancestral states and phylogenetic parameters \citep{Sagulenko2018-xl} is not consistent in general.
Specifically, we have shown that the only generating parameters that yield consistent branch length estimates given the correct topology lie in a set of measure zero.
In addition, in the case of four-taxon trees with infinite data, we have obtained nontrivial regions of generating parameters that result in topological ambiguity: the joint inference procedure estimates zero-length branches, which can be considered as a multifurcating topology.
Also, the incorrect topology attains the same likelihood as the topology that generated the data by fixing this branch to have zero length.
Since the parameters with the highest likelihood given the generating topology include a zero-length branch, we cannot exclude the possibility that the incorrect topology with this branch having nonzero length is more likely to be observed, though we have not found regions where this is the case.
The regions of inconsistency we found arise when one set of sister branches of the generating trees are ``long,'' that is, when the top branch fidelities tend to be small, and when the lower branches are ``short,'' i.e., have large fidelities.
We see that this inconsistency occurs even if some branches are short.
This expands on the empirical findings of poor estimation given long branches in \citet{Sagulenko2018-xl} (their Figures~2 and~3).
However, the problems are not just for long branches as \citet{Sagulenko2018-xl} imply: even when all branches are short there is a consistent bias, and the bias is on the same order as the magnitude of the parameters (Fig.~\ref{fig:empirical-bias}).

Joint inference of tree parameters and ancestral sequences is a type of profile likelihood, a well-studied subject in statistics \citep{Murphy2000-ry}.
Many properties regarding the performance of maximum likelihood estimates obtained using this approach are known, and many methods exist to overcome their undesirable properties, e.g., the method of sieves \citep{Geman1982}.
A potential solution in this case using the method of sieves could be to project the column-wise ancestral states into a lower-dimensional space, allowing the degrees of freedom in the ancestral state columns to grow with $\nCols$, albeit more slowly than $O(\nCols)$.
Elsewhere in statistics literature, the failure of maximum likelihood estimates to obtain consistent estimates as the number of parameters goes to infinity have been shown by the Neyman-Scott paradox \citep{Neyman1948-tt}, though parameters tending to infinity is not a necessary condition for inconsistency \citep{LeCam1990}.
Consistency proofs of standard maximum likelihood estimates of phylogeny \eqref{eq:marginal_likelihood} are recent \citep{Allman2008-wd,Chai2011-ff,RoyChoudhury2015-ta}, and no results have been obtained for profile likelihood.
We have furthered progress in understanding the limitations of this joint optimization procedure.

Previous work in phylogenetics has developed consistency counterexamples using similar four-taxon topologies to the one used here \citep{Felsenstein1978-rr}.
In this previous work, when simulating data under the Felsenstein topology $\tau_2$, as the number of observations increases, the InvFels topology $\tau_1$ becomes more likely when performing a particular estimation procedure.
We have shown cases in which, when generating from the InvFels topology, we converge to a multifurcating topology, with one or more branch lengths estimated to be zero.
Moreover, the inconsistency demonstrated by \citet{Felsenstein1978-rr} is attributed to long branch attraction, i.e., the fact that there may be multiple long branches where parallel changes are more likely than a single change along a short branch.
This is not the case here; while analytically the inconsistency occurs on a four-taxon tree when one pair of sister branches are long and the other three are short, we see empirically that this inconsistency is present in roughly half of the entire parameter space, and occurs when the true branches generate data that more likely has no change along the interior branch.
Additionally, we generate data on the InvFels tree $\tau_1$ while \citet{Felsenstein1978-rr} generates data on the Felsenstein tree $\tau_2$.
Difficulties in phylogenetic estimation when generating data on the InvFels tree have been found by \citet{Siddall1998-hq}, though \citet{Swofford2001-hr} show that the difficulties come from insufficient sequence length, which is not the case here.

The case of joint inference of a phylogenetic likelihood is discussed in \citet{Goldman1990-dk}.
There, Goldman provides a worked example in which estimating a topology with fixed branch lengths is equivalent to parsimony and thus not guaranteed to be consistent, though he does not discuss the inconsistency of joint inference in general.
We show cases where the incorrect topology attains an equal likelihood value at the maximum as the correct topology, and, moreover, if we know the correct topology, we show cases where branch lengths are severely biased and cannot be consistent.
Finally, just prior to his conclusion, he discusses when parsimony gives the same answer as maximum likelihood, concluding that the question is ill-posed since parsimony estimates different parameters than maximum likelihood, i.e., it assumes equal branch lengths.
Our question, in contrast, is well-posed: the joint inference procedure outlined here estimates the same parameters as classical maximum likelihood---topology and branch lengths---albeit implicitly estimating ancestral states as well.
We are able to provide much more detail on how large branch lengths must be for general joint inference to fail to be consistent.

%The equal branch length example occurs in Example 2, starting halfway down the second column of page 352 in Goldman (1990) and continuing until the top of the second column on page 354.
%Here he only talks about how parsimony is inconsistent because it may result in equally parsimonious trees (this is the last paragraph of the example section).
%It's not until the bottom of page 356 that he punts the inconsistency to Felsenstein and Hendy/Penny, and the bottom of page 357 where he wonders how small branch lengths have to be for parsimony to be consistent in general.

We have shown an inconsistency when performing joint inference on branch lengths given an InvFels topology and investigated the performance of branch parameter estimation.
There is substantial scope for future work to make these results more precise and more general.
All of these results hold only for a simple binary symmetric model on four-taxon trees, and extensive simulation is necessary to understand how these results extend to more complicated general cases, such as applied examples with larger trees or more realistic mutation models that are of interest to practitioners.
Also, given that many of the bounds presented here are in the form of level sets of multivariate polynomials, a more formal approach using algebraic geometric techniques may reveal more stable or interesting patterns of inconsistency; see \citet{Sturmfels2002} for a thorough treatment of solving systems of polynomial equations.
Finally, all of the material presented here concerns joint estimation under maximum likelihood, and does not pose any problem for other settings, such as joint sampling of trees and ancestral sequences in a Bayesian framework.
